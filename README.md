# üöó Driver Drowsiness Detection System  

> ‚ö° A Computer Vision + IoT project that keeps you awake on the road.  

This system uses **MediaPipe Face Mesh** and **OpenCV** to monitor the driver‚Äôs eyes in real time.  
When it detects that the driver is sleepy (eyes closed for too long), it:  
- Triggers a **buzzer** sound on the PC,  
- Turns the **LED from green to red**, and  
- **Stops the motor** (simulating the car halting).  

All of this happens through **WiFi communication** with an **ESP8266 NodeMCU**,  
making this a cool blend of **AI + IoT safety automation**.

## ‚ú® Features
- ‚úÖ Real-time eye closure detection using **MediaPipe FaceMesh**  
- ‚úÖ Wireless communication between **Python app ‚Üî NodeMCU (ESP8266)**  
- ‚úÖ Smart hardware response:
  - üü¢ **Green LED** ‚Üí Driver awake  
  - üî¥ **Red LED** ‚Üí Driver drowsy  
  - ‚öôÔ∏è **Motor ON/OFF** ‚Üí Simulated vehicle control  
  - üîä **PC-based buzzer** ‚Üí Audible drowsiness alert  
- ‚úÖ On-screen status overlay for:
  - Driver State: `ACTIVE / SLEEPING / NO FACE`
  - NodeMCU Connection: `Connected / Disconnected`

## ‚ö° Circuit Connections

| Component | NodeMCU Pin | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Green LED | D1 (GPIO 5) | Anode ‚Üí via 220Œ© resistor |
| Red LED | D2 (GPIO 4) | Anode ‚Üí via 220Œ© resistor |
| Buzzer (Optional) | D3 (GPIO 0) | Positive pin |
| Motor IN | D5 (GPIO 14) | To motor driver input |
| GND | ‚Äî | Common ground for all |

### üß† Notes:
- Always connect **NodeMCU GND** and **motor driver GND** together.  
- Use a **separate 5‚Äì12V supply** for the motor if possible.  
- Ensure LED resistors are used (~220Œ©) to avoid burning pins.
